# Developer Week Hackathon 2019 - Pandemic
Pandemic aims to prevent the spread of diseases by crowdsourcing data from hospitals, making these diagnoses available to doctors starting from patient 0. With real time disease trends, doctors can more accurately respond to cases by ordering the correct diagnostics. Pandemic also be notifies doctors if a case should be reported to CDC by law and allow them to seamlessly complete and send the form on the platform.
